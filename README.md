# Experimental raw data (PbS/OA QDs)
## PL + abs
Absorbance (Abs.txt) and photoluminescence (PLspectra) data. PL spectra are measured under 515 nm laser excitation at power densities 341 W/cm2 (PLspectra_6uW 60x2avg per 1s.txt) and 56.9 kW/cm2 (PLspectra_1mW 60x2avg per 1s.txt), respectively.
## TR PL
Time-resolved photoluminescence data measured under long duration (LD, 25us length) and short duration (SD, 70 ns) excitation laser pulses. Laser power is given in uW. OD filters if present in the file name were used to decrease a signal between the sample and APD. "no.seq" stay for the number of sweeps (repetitions). The time step is 25 us.
